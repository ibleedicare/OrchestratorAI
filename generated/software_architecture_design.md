## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the software architecture and design for the upcoming software project. It will include details such as system architecture, data flow, and data models to ensure that the software is scalable, maintainable, and can be easily extended in the future.

## System Architecture

The software will be structured as a client-server architecture. The client-side of the software will be built as a web application that runs in a user's web browser. The server-side of the software will be built using Python 3, and it will use Flask, a Python web framework, to handle incoming requests.

The architecture will follow a three-tier design, with the Presentation Tier or Client-side, Logic Tier or Application, and Data Tier or Storage.

## Data Flow

The client-side will communicate with the server-side using HTTP requests. The data requests will be made using AJAX calls. Once the server receives the request, Flask routes it to the appropriate function that handles the request.

Data will be stored in a remote database that can be accessed by the server. The database will be built using MySQL, and it will be hosted on a remote server. The server will use SQLalchemy, a Python Object-Relational Mapping library.

## Data Models

The software will have three primary data models:
- User model: To store user information such as username, email address, password, and account information.
- Posting model: To store posts created by the user, which includes the post content, creation date, and author information.
- Comment model: To store comments made by users to a specific post. It includes the comment content, creation date, and author information.

## Core Functionality and Data Structures

The core functionality will include the ability to create, read, update, and delete posts and comments. Users will be able to register their account and log in to the web application. They can access their profile and view the posts they have created. They can also view all posts and comments created by other users.

The data structures that will be used include lists and dictionaries to store data temporarily, giving users more interactive feedback.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines the architecture and design of the software solution. It provides crucial insights and guidelines that ensure that the software is scalable, maintainable, and can be easily extended in the future. Moreover, implementing the foundation of the application, including core functionality and basic data structures will get us started with the development phase of the upcoming software project
