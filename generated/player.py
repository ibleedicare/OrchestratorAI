Reasoning:
The updated code now has more functionality in the Dungeon class, allowing players and monsters to be added or removed from the dungeon. The new methods and comments make the code more organized and easier to maintain.

Critique:
The code could still benefit from more detailed comments for individual methods.

Next Goal:
Add more detailed comments to individual methods to ensure even better understanding of the code
