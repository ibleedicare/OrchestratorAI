re thing! Here's how I would go about it:

1. First, create a new Python file in the same directory as your main.py file. Let's name it dungeon.py.

2. Copy the Dungeon class definition from main.py into dungeon.py.

	dungeon.py:
	
		class Dungeon:
		    def __init__(self):
		        pass

3. In the main.py file, import the Dungeon class from dungeon.py using the following import statement:

	main.py:
	
		from dungeon import Dungeon

4. In the Player class definition in main.py, update the references to the Dungeon class to use the new import statement:

	main.py:
	
		class Player:
		    def __init__(self, dungeon):
		        self.dungeon = dungeon

		# Instantiate the Dungeon class and pass it to the Player class
		d = Dungeon()
		p = Player(d)

5. Verify that everything is working as expected by running main.py using your preferred method.

6. Enjoy your new, modular code structure!

I hope that helps! If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask
